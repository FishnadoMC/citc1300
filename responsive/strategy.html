            <h2>Sharpen your skills with expert tips and strategies for every squad type and play style.</h2>
            <p>The best players always scope out the playing area beforehand, and try to familiarize themselves with the rules of engaging, shooting, and cover that they might use while in various positions on the battlefield.</p>

            <h3>Official Killzone: Octarius</h3>
            <p>You may try to hold an objective out in the open, getting more points and putting your team at risk, or you can try to move to strike for the most damage.</p>

            <h1>Advanced Strategies</h1>
            <h2>For players looking to go deeper, this section covers advanced tactics for competitive play.</h2>
            <p> A great player knows that his enemy wants to wipe him out in the most efficient way possible, a better player forces the other to get into positions that put them at a disadvantage, by ambush or line of sight.</p>
