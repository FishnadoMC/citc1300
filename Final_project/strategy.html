                    <h2>Advanced Tactics and Competetive Gameplay</h2>
                    <p>A great player knows that his enemy wants to wipe him out in the most efficient way possible, a better player forces the other to get into positions that put them at a disadvantage, by ambush or line of sight.</p>
                    <p>To be the good at Kill Team, you have to roll dice well, but to be the best, you need to know when best to roll them. Spreading enemies out often makes for easier targets, but heftier foes can tank damage, so confusing or disorienting the enemy may be a better approach.</p>

                    <p>While some information is kept secret from you, like faction-specific chosen abilities, other info isn't! Use the data cards and info online to recognize and differentiate the strength of an enemy with a flamethrower vs. the range of an ally with a lasrifle, or if possible, the size of detonation of either side's bomb.</p>
                    <p>With over 30 and counting Official Kill Teams, theres alot to learn, but that just means more fun to be had!</p>
