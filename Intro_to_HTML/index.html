    <h1>Learning to play a new game that I have to make myself.</h1>
        <p>I recently began collecting Miniatures for a new Skirmish Action game called Kill Team, made by &copy;Games Workshop, who make the Warhammer franchise. I've never assembled or painted Miniatures before, so this page will be my sort of journal of learning.I have had an interest in Warhammer for several years now, but the game is extremely pricey, with some teams having a barrier of over $1000 to even get started, so instead I elected to play a quicker and more inexpesive version.</p>
    <hr><h2>What is a Skirmish Action Game?</h2>
        <p>Commonly called Skirmish games, two players against each other using collections of small, plastic miniatures and has them fight over an objective for points, or in special "ops" where one team may need to defend a payload or object and the other may try to destroy or steal it.</p>

        <p>Kill Team is unique in the fact that it uses models from the Warhammer 40,000 universe, which has all sorts of teams to choose from, such as</p>
        <ul>

    </ul>
        <p>And many, many more. I have gotten the humans and orks, and will document my journey into the unknown world of hobby collecting and painting.</p>
<hr><h2>Understanding the Basics</h2>
<p>The rules of each Kill Team can be found <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/xfV8vUOg/download-the-kill-team-app-and-faction-rules-today/" target="_blank">here</a>, along with a few other situational rules that have to do with where the "ops" are occuring.</p>
<p>The important thing to understand though is that players will take turns activating each operative on their team, until they both run out. There are many things that can go on in between, like fighting shooting, running, or operating an objective, but I won't get into that, instead focusing on the model process.</p>
<h3>How to Assemble</h3>
<p>These models do not come assembled, instead being placed on sprues (pictured below) made by liquid plastic molding</p>

<p>To successfully remove the models from the sprues, you'll need a pair of flush pliers that can leave as small a mark as possible, some files to smooth any excess plastic, and some superglue to attach your models's limbs.</p>
